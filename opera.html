        Will not Lisa look delightful?
        Smiles and tears in plenty shedding—
        Which in brides of course is rightful
        One could say, if one were spiteful,
        Contradiction little dreading,
        Her bouquet is simply frightful—
        Still, 'twill be a pretty wedding!
        Oh, it is a pretty wedding!
        Such a pretty, pretty wedding!</p1>

    <p class="speech">If upon her train she stumbled,
        On one's train one's always treading.</p>

    <h6 class="GRET">GRET</h6>

        On life's journey gaily start them.
        Soon to be for aye united,
        Till divorce or death shall part them.</p>
